### Hacker News (later):
**Title**: Show HN: Architecture diagram builder in Angular with 47+ cloud/AI components

**Description**:
```
I built an open-source architecture diagram builder using Angular and Konva.js.

It includes 47+ pre-built components for AWS, Azure, GCP, and AI/ML tools (LangChain, vector databases, LLMs, etc.). Features drag-and-drop, nested grouping, custom components with image upload, and JSON export.

Live demo: https://samba425.github.io/konva-architecture-canvas/

Started this because I needed a quick way to visualize RAG architectures and cloud infrastructure for documentation. Turns out it's useful for system design interviews and technical presentations too.

Built with Angular 21 and Konva.js for high-performance canvas rendering. MIT licensed.

Would love feedback on what features to add next!
