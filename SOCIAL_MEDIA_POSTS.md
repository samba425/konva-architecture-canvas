### Post 1: Professional Announcement
```
🚀 Excited to announce the launch of konva-architecture-canvas!

After months of development, I've published an open-source Angular component for creating professional architecture diagrams.

𝗪𝗵𝘆 𝗜 𝗯𝘂𝗶𝗹𝘁 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝘀:
As a solutions architect, I found myself spending hours creating and recreating architecture diagrams. I needed a tool that:
• Integrated with our Angular stack
• Had cloud and AI/ML components built-in

𝗞𝗲𝘆 𝗙𝗲𝗮𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲𝘀:
✅ 47+ pre-built components (AWS, Azure, GCP, AI/ML tools)
✅ Professional drawing tools
✅ Smart grouping and connections
✅ Export to PNG/JSON/SVG
✅ Dark mode
✅ Full keyboard shortcuts

𝗧𝗲𝗰𝗵 𝗦𝘁𝗮𝗰𝗸:
Built with Angular 21, Konva.js, and TypeScript

𝗢𝗽𝗲𝗻 𝗦𝗼𝘂𝗿𝗰𝗲:
MIT licensed and available on npm!

📦 Install: npm install konva-architecture-canvas
🚀 Demo: https://samba425.github.io/konva-architecture-canvas/
⭐ GitHub: https://github.com/samba425/konva-architecture-canvas

Would love to hear your thoughts! What features would be most valuable for your team?

### Post 2: Problem-Focused
```
𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗵𝗶𝗱𝗱𝗲𝗻 𝗰𝗼𝘀𝘁 𝗼𝗳 𝗮𝗿𝗰𝗵𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲 𝗱𝗶𝗮𝗴𝗿𝗮𝗺𝘀: ⏰

On average, engineers spend 2-3 hours per week creating and updating architecture diagrams. That's:
• 100+ hours per year per engineer
• $15,000+ in engineering time annually
• Outdated docs because updates are tedious

𝗜 𝘀𝗼𝗹𝘃𝗲𝗱 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝘀 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗺𝘆 𝘁𝗲𝗮𝗺:

Built an open-source diagram tool with:
→ 47+ pre-built components (no more icon hunting)
→ Version control via JSON export
→ Keyboard shortcuts (reduce mouse time)
→ Template system (reuse common patterns)

Result: Diagram creation time cut by 60% 📊

The tool is now available as an npm package:
https://www.npmjs.com/package/konva-architecture-canvas

Perfect for:
• Cloud architecture documentation
• System design reviews
• Technical presentations
• Onboarding materials

Try the demo: https://samba425.github.io/konva-architecture-canvas/

### Post 3: Technical Deep Dive
```
𝗧𝗲𝗰𝗵𝗻𝗶𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝗗𝗲𝗲𝗽 𝗗𝗶𝘃𝗲: Building a High-Performance Canvas Editor

Just shipped konva-architecture-canvas, and wanted to share some interesting technical decisions:

𝟭. 𝗖𝗮𝗻𝘃𝗮𝘀 𝘃𝘀 𝗦𝗩𝗚:
Chose Konva.js (canvas) over D3.js (SVG) for:
• Better performance with 50+ objects
• Smooth 60 FPS interactions
• Easier event handling

Trade-off: Larger bundle size, but worth it for UX

𝟮. 𝗦𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝗠𝗮𝗻𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁:
Implemented command pattern for undo/redo:
• Serialized state snapshots
• Efficient history management
• Easy state restoration

𝟯. 𝗣𝗲𝗿𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝗢𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗶𝘇𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀:
• Icon caching
• Virtual scrolling for components
• Layer separation (background/content/interaction)
• Event debouncing

𝟰. 𝗗𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗹𝗼𝗽𝗲𝗿 𝗘𝘅𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲:
• Standalone Angular components (easy integration)
• TypeScript for type safety
• Comprehensive keyboard shortcuts
• JSON export for version control

Open sourced the entire project:
GitHub: https://github.com/samba425/konva-architecture-canvas

Happy to discuss any of these decisions! What would you have done differently?

## Hacker News Post

**Title**: Show HN: Architecture diagram builder in Angular with 47+ cloud/AI components

**Text**:
```
I built an open-source architecture diagram builder using Angular and Konva.js.

It includes 47+ pre-built components for AWS, Azure, GCP, and AI/ML tools (LangChain, vector databases, LLMs, etc.). Features drag-and-drop, nested grouping, custom components with image upload, and JSON export.

Live demo: https://samba425.github.io/konva-architecture-canvas/

Started this because I needed a quick way to visualize RAG architectures and cloud infrastructure for documentation. Turns out it's useful for system design interviews and technical presentations too.

Built with Angular 21 and Konva.js for high-performance canvas rendering. MIT licensed.

The tool addresses some pain points I had with existing solutions:

1. Integration: It's an npm package, not a separate app
2. Components: Pre-built tech stack components (no icon hunting)
3. Export: JSON format for version control
4. Keyboard-driven: Full shortcuts (Cmd+G, Cmd+Z, etc.)

Some interesting technical decisions:
- Chose canvas (Konva) over SVG (D3) for better performance
- Implemented command pattern for undo/redo
- Virtual scrolling for component sidebar
- Auto-save to localStorage

Current limitations:
- No real-time collaboration (yet)
- Limited to web (no offline desktop app)
- Bundle size ~680KB

Roadmap:
- Export to Terraform/CDK
- Custom component creator
- AI-powered auto-layout
- VS Code extension

Would love feedback on what features to prioritize!

npm: npm install konva-architecture-canvas

**First Comment (Maker)**:
```
Hi Product Hunt! 👋

I'm the creator of Konva Architecture Canvas. Here's why I built it:

THE PROBLEM:
As a solutions architect, I was spending 2-3 hours every week creating architecture diagrams. The process was frustrating:
- Opening separate apps (Draw.io, Lucidchart)
- Searching for cloud service icons
- Recreating the same components repeatedly
- Losing work when browser crashed
- No version control for diagrams

THE SOLUTION:
Built an Angular component with:
- 47+ pre-built tech components
- Smart grouping and connections
- Export to PNG (docs) and JSON (version control)
- Keyboard shortcuts (Cmd+G, Cmd+Z, etc.)
- Auto-save to never lose work

TECH STACK:
- Angular 21 (reactive framework)
- Konva.js (canvas rendering)
- TypeScript (type safety)
- MIT licensed (completely free!)

USE CASES:
→ RAG chatbot architectures
→ Microservices documentation
→ Cloud infrastructure diagrams
→ System design interviews

WHAT'S SPECIAL:
Unlike Draw.io or Lucidchart, this integrates directly into your Angular projects as an npm package. You can programmatically generate diagrams, version control them as JSON, and customize the component library.

ROADMAP:
- Real-time collaboration
- Export to Terraform/CDK
- Custom component creator
- VS Code extension
- AI-powered auto-layout

I'd love your feedback! What features would make this more useful for your team?
